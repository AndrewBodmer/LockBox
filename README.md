# LockBox
Overview  
We want to take on the construction of this project as an opportunity to expand our cybersecurity knowledge beyond what we have been learning in the classroom. This project was inspired by the increasing need for secure file storage solutions, particularly in environments where sensitive information must be protected. By creating a secure file storage system, we aim to develop a solution that ensures the confidentiality and availability of stored documents. This project will not only enhance our technical skills but also provide a foundation for future advanced projects in cybersecurity.



Goals
- Obtain mastery of version control using Git and GitHub, which are crucial for collaborative project development.
- Increase proficiency in Python, Flask, SQL, as well as cryptography libraries, and how these platforms will have to communicate with each other.
- Develop a secure file storage system that encrypts files and ensures controlled access.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control to manage file access.
- Ensure the system is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.


Milestones

Mid June: Planning and Environment Setup
- Discuss and finalize project requirements and user stories.
- Set up the development environment with the necessary tools and libraries.

End of June: User Authentication Module
- Develop user registration and login forms.
- Implement password hashing and session management.

Mid July: File Encryption and Decryption
- Write encryption and decryption functions.
- Test the encryption and decryption of sample files.

End of July: File Upload and Download
- Create file upload and download interfaces.
- Integrate encryption and decryption with file upload/download processes.

Mid August: User Interface and Frontend Development
- Build the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Create a file management dashboard.

Mid August: Documentation and Deployment
- Document the code and create a user manual.
- Deploy the application and perform final checks.

In the future: Security Measures and Testing
- Implement data integrity checks and secure communication.
- Perform unit, integration, and security testing.



Short-term Goals:
- Efficient: Ensure the system handles file encryption and decryption without significant lag.
- Functional: Enable users to securely upload, download, and manage files.
- User-friendly GUI: Design an intuitive interface for easy navigation.
- Secure: Implement strong security measures to protect stored files.



Long-term Goals:
- User profiles with detailed account management options.
- Admin interface for monitoring information/site status
- Integration with more advanced encryption techniques and multi-factor authentication.
- Scalability to handle a larger number of users and files securely.



Final Deliverables:
- A fully functional secure file storage system.
- Documentation and user manual.
- A deployed application accessible to users.
